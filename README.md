# Lightweight-Deep-Learning-for-Human-Activity-Recognition-HAR-
We developed a robust deep-learning model to accurately identify and classify human activities using data from smartphone sensors. The project focused on optimizing the model for performance and efficiency, making it suitable for deployment on devices with limited computational resources. The project utilizes three well-known datasets: UCI-HAR, WISDM, and KU-HAR. For each dataset, we implemented and evaluated six deep-learning models: BiLSTM, ResBiLSTM, LSTM, ResLSTM, NN, and ResCNN.
